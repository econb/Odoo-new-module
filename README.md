# Odoo-new-module
Odoo is an open source ERP system, previously named OpenERP. It is made in Python ;)  
In this project I build a new module for Odoo that complies the following requirements:
- Propose ideas. Each idea has the fields Name, Group, Description, Votes, Score (average of the score of the votes).
- Vote ideas. Each vote has the fields Score (decimal, 0-10), Person, Datetime.
- Every idea has a start and finish voting date. The finish date should be set automatically one month later
after the start date.
- Grouping people. Each group is composed of a Name and various Persons.
